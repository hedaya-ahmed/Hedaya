      <p>My opinion about them is that they are exciting and students get the chance to take a brake from school, waking up early and enjoy 
          without any pressure about exams or homeworks that student have to do.

      <p>Cricket is a famous game in India.<br/>
    I find it very interesting but I don't know the rules or how to play it as in my country, they don't play it<br/>
    Football is played the most in country, I do see people playing cricket sometimes but they are Indians, I hope to learn to play this game one day</p>
